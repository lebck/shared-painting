# Shared painting
This is the prototype of a "shared painting" application. It uses websockets and node.js
Currently it is possible to paint something in the canvas on the site. Other browsers on the same site 
will see what you paint and you will see what they paint.

## setup

```bash
# install npm dependencies
npm install 

# start server 
npm start
```

Application is using ES6 and runs only in the latest browser versions! Tested in Chrome 71 and Safari 12
